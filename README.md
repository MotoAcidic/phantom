# Phantom-node Daemon

![Phantom Logo](./phantomlogo.png)

Phantom nodes requires no static IP address, no copy of the blockchain, and no proof-of-service. As such, you can run a node on any IP address of your liking: `1.1.1.1` or `8.8.8.8` if you wish. Phantoms also support live hot-swap with currently running nodes, there is no need to re-queue.

The phantom daemon is extremely lightweight allowing you to run hundreds of nodes from a modest machine if you wished. And, possibly most importantly, you can move your currently running masternodes to phantom nodes without restarting since a real IP address is no longer a requirement.

The phantom daemon is custom built wallet designed to replicate only what is required for pre-EVO masternodes to run; it replaces the masternode daemon piece. It does not handle any wallet private keys and has no access to your coins. You will still need a wallet to start your masternodes, but once started, the phatom node system will handle the rest for you.

## Updated
Phantom v0.0.4.2
Original Dev breakcrypto, modified by carsenk & CircuitBreaker

- Added Innova (INN) Support
- Added peer caching to peers.db

# Feature

* Fully self-sufficient
* Minimal memory and disk usage (in the 10s of megabytes vs. gigabytes)
* Hot-swap with live node daemons, no restart required
* Select any IP address, no static IP required
* Auto-load settings from a coinconf.json
* Optionally auto-load bootstrap hashes and peers from Iquidus explorers (more APIs coming soon)
* Epoch timestamp support for high-availability deterministic pings
* Use your existing masternode.conf if you don't want deterministic pings
* Runs on windows, linux, mac, arm, and more.

# A note from the developer

Phantoms have been released to make it easier, and less costly, for masternode supporters to host their own nodes. Masternode hosting companies are free to utilize the phantom system as long as they comply with the terms of the Server Side Public License.

# Quick start

Download a binary release from below. See if there's a coin configuration for the coin you're wishing to use. If not, you'll need to locate the proper settings. There are notes below on where to look or feel free to ask on discord, reddit, or btct. If there is a coin conf for your coin then switching over to phantoms is easy:

```
./phantom -coin_conf="/path/to/coin.conf" -masternode_conf="/path/to/masternode.conf"
```

That's it. You do not need to restart your masternodes, you don't need to change IP addresses, etc. Once the phantom daemon is running, you can disable your masternode daemons, cancel most of VPS subscriptions, and enjoy the savings. You'll know the phantoms are working when you see the active time refresh (can take up to 20 minutes). If that active time doesn't update, restart your daemons and check the settings.

# Setup

The setup is simple: copy your masternode.conf or fortunastake.conf, modify it slightly, launch the phantom executable.

## Masternode.txt setup

Copy your masternode.conf or fortunastake.conf to the same folder as the phantom executable. Rename it to masternode.txt. Remove any comment lines from the top of the file (i.e. delete any line starting with #). At the end of each line add a epoch time ( https://www.unixtimestamp.com ). The epoch timestamp is utilized to allow you to run multiple phantom node setups in a deterministic manner, creating a highly-available configuration.

**Example**

`masternode.conf`
```
# Masternode config file
# Format: alias IP:port masternodeprivkey collateral_output_txid collateral_output_index
mn1 45.50.22.125:17817 73HaYBVUCYjEMeeH1Y4sBGLALQZE1Yc1K64xiqgX37tGBDQL8Xg 2bcd3c84c84f87eaa86e4e56834c92927a07f9e18718810b92e0d0324456a67c 1
```

becomes:

`masternode.txt`
```
mn1 45.50.22.125:17817 73HaYBVUCYjEMeeH1Y4sBGLALQZE1Yc1K64xiqgX37tGBDQL8Xg 2bcd3c84c84f87eaa86e4e56834c92927a07f9e18718810b92e0d0324456a67c 1 1555847365
```

comments removed, epoch timestamp added to the end.

## Run the phantom executable

```
./phantom-linux-amd64 -magicbytes="b73ff4fa" -port=14530 -protocol_number=33500 -magic_message="Innova Signed Message:" -bootstrap_url="https://innova.pro" -max_connections=150 -bootstrap_ips="140.82.16.72:14530"
```

## Coin configurations exist for
